Public life in the Team City
============================

Piazza is a build monitor plugin for the JetBrains [TeamCity](http://www.jetbrains.com/teamcity/) [continuous integration](http://www.martinfowler.com/articles/continuousIntegration.html) server.
Piazza provides a high-visibility display of the current state of the build to alert the team as soon as the build breaks.


For any build, Piazza displays:

 * The project and build name
 * The current build number
 * Whether the build is "red" or "green"
 * Textual success/failure indication for the colour-blind
 * Whether the Team City server is currently building
 * The changes that caused the current build to be kicked off
 * Pictures of the team members that made those changes
 * The progress of the build
 * The build step that the Team City agent is currently running
 * The number of passed, failed and ignored tests

Piazza can also display an overview of all the builds in a project.
